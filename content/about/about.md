>yep thats me :)


Other interests:

Not much, tbh. I like tinkering with computers and wasting time. I can be found writing inane programs and I take great pleasure in documenting them. I have been told that I have a good sense of humor and that I am atleast 30% cool. I have also been told that I am an idiot. And I like to believe that I have a good sense of humor.
