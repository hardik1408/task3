# STATIC SITE GENERATOR - TASK 3

It was very late by the time I realized that we had to actually make a Static Site generator instead of a static site using hugo or any other SSG.
I know I will not be awarded any points for this task, but still I am adding the link to the static site I built. I hope you take into consideration the time and efforts I gave for this.

I even implemented a commenting system using `Disqus` in my static site.
